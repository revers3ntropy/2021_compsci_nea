 Hello! Hope you like my computer science GSCE Non-Examened Assessment.


 System requirements:
	- pygame
	- python > 3.0
    - pickle

Would just like to note a few things:

	- If the program can't find pygame, check that you have pygame installed on the IDE you 
		are using.
	- If the text seems to be off-center, try re-running it. Not sure why this helps. if that
		doesn't help, you might need to set the mid_x fudge factor in 
		program_listing/full/renderer. I am pretty sure that this is just a quirk of repl.
	- I took lots of stuff from a project I did over lockdown, and didn't include this in the 
		time. Almost everything in buttons.py, typing.py, curser.py and tick.py was taken
		from this project.
	- You can find this project under reverse3ntropy.com/chaos.html, although to run it is a 
		pain.
	- I based my commenting design off the code for Battlefont by EA.
	- This project was done entriley in repl.it, and I have not tested it for 'normal' IDEs.
		This might mean that importing files is different acorss platforms, so try to run it 
		on repl.it if it is being runned. 
	- I have noticed that repl.it has added some 'interesting' things to my project, so if
        you see any '<<<<<<< HEAD' or '>>>>>>> origin/master' that is not part of the project.
    - Saving to files does not work very well in repl, so it might be a little  buggy

  Would also like to point you to revers3ntropy.com and to revers3ntropy on GitHub for a few more programming projects from me!
